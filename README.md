This is project 2 of 5 in the Responsive Web Design certification from freecodecamp. 

This is supposed to be a culmination of the second series of practice projects. It gives a set of requirements for you to be able to submit and move on.
For this second project a tribute page was to be built. I made a tribute page to Nikola Tesla.
